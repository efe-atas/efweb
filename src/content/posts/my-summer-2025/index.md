I talked about my summer goals

Let's talk about what happened
- yes, I found a very good internship
- 4 LeetCode questions :/
- one day or day one :/
- I gave up learning any framework, I focused on learning theory
- my English skills are still at the same level
- smile 3 times a day (yes, I did it)
- I had never thought about going abroad this summer but I went to Germany for 5 days, it was excellent
- I also went on a very beautiful holiday

## What happened in my internship

ChatGPT is killing my writing skills. I am too lazy to tell my internship adventure. But let me try.
This was my first big company internship. One of the biggest software companies in Turkey. I worked in the Big Data and AI team for 30 workdays.
At first, I was really annoyed by the procedures of a big company. I had to wait for my laptop for 4 days. I was used to being fast at work in my previous company (a start-up).
I forgot to tell you, they gave us a thermos, hat, and bag. I really liked the thermos and I'm still using it btw. The first week of the internship did not feel good to me. But later weeks we took the case and researched it.
It was an audio classification problem. At first, I thought it was a simple problem. But the domain of the problem was really problematic. We needed to do a lot of work: researching methods, data scraping, data cleaning, model-driven development, later data-driven development, and we also created an end-to-end full stack app for the user who would use it later. There are also plenty of other things but I cannot explain them due to my contract.

## What happened in Germany :flag_de:

My friend called me and said let's go to Germany and I said yes, so we bought the tickets and went to Germany. Yes, it happened like that. I don't want to explain a lot of things about my journey but I want to share my observations:

- KEBAP DONER IN ANKARA (TURKEY) IS FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN GERMANY. BUT THE PORTION OF DONER IN GERMANY IS NEARLY THREE TIMES MORE THAN IN TURKEY.
- Most people obey the rules willingly.
- Churches everywhere like in other EU countries.
- I ate my first FIVE GUYS, a huge delicious burger. I wrote a note on a table in Munich Five Guys, I hope you will see it.
- Public transportation is okay.
- YES, CARS ARE CHEAPER and I saw a lot of luxury cars on the road.
- In urinals there is no separator. That was my culture shock.
- I ate the best ice cream I have ever eaten.
- Turkish Kiraathane in Germany feels like a casino.
- NATURE is great. Everywhere is green and peaceful. I was thinking Germany was a grey country.
- Fun culture is great. I went to a concert in Augsburg, it was very fun. People are very nice.
- I used ChatGPT a lot during this trip, it helped me a lot.

Maybe I forgot to mention something about my travel but I think this is enough for now.
